I was reading "Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Tensorflow" (a very good book, if I may add), there was the example on Model Based Learning, the author asked; Suppose you want to know if money makes people happy, and it got me thinking, how would I go about answering this? For this analysis, I scraped happiness report data from wikipedia in addition to suicide rates. CLeaned and visulized different factors, in addition to looking out for any correlations, finally I built an ML model based on KNN regrssion algorithm to predict score of happiness for countries. The model had an accurcy of 70%.
